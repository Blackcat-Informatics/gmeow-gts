# GTS — Graph Transport Substrate — Specification

**Document version:** 0.3 (draft) &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Wire-format major version:** 1 &nbsp;·&nbsp;
**Date:** 2026-06-11 &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Editor:** Patrick Audley, Blackcat Informatics® Inc. &nbsp;·&nbsp;
**This version:** <https://github.com/Blackcat-Informatics/gmeow-gts/blob/main/docs/GTS-SPEC.md>

## Abstract

GTS (Graph Transport Substrate) is an ontology-independent binary container and transport
format for RDF 1.2 datasets and content-addressed binary payloads. A GTS file is a CBOR
Sequence of one or more append-only segments. Each segment consists of a deterministic-CBOR
header followed by deterministic-CBOR frames linked by BLAKE3 content identifiers. The logical
dataset is obtained by a deterministic fold over the segment sequence. GTS supports partial
readability, opaque encrypted or unknown-codec frames, append-only suppression, optional
signatures and encryption, and cross-language conformance through a shared vector corpus.

## Status of this document

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | Working draft |
| Document version | 0.3 (draft) |
| Wire-format major version | 1, encoded in the segment header `"v"` field |
| Date | 2026-06-11 |
| Stability | Wire-format changes remain possible until v1.0 |
| Change control | Blackcat Informatics / GTS specification process |
| Conformance | Defined by this document and the versioned vector corpus (§19) |
| Implementation versions | Package versions are independent release artifacts |
| Corpus version | The corpus is versioned separately from package releases |

This specification is maintained in the
[`gmeow-gts`](https://github.com/Blackcat-Informatics/gmeow-gts) repository, alongside four
interoperable reference engines (Rust, Python, Go, TypeScript) that gate against the shared
vector corpus. Report errata and propose changes there.

GTS is ontology-independent. GMEOW is a primary downstream consumer and distribution use case
for GTS, but GTS readers and writers do not require GMEOW vocabulary, tooling, or semantics.
Domain-specific profiles, including GMEOW and music-package profiles, are layered above the
core format.

**Changes in v0.3:**

- Multi-segment files (`cat`-append composition, §3.1); segment-scoped term-ids (§7.2);
  per-segment fold and value-union semantics (§7.5); cross-segment suppression (§11); profile
  union and per-section language-tag discipline (§13); composition-tool requirements (§14.1);
  conformance vectors 15–21 (§19).
- Layout states and the streamable claim (§3.3, §5); streamable compaction with detached frame
  signatures (§10.1); the `stream` vocabulary (§13.3); the `compact` verb (§14.1); conformance
  vectors 24–26 (§19).

## 1. Overview and non-goals

GTS encodes a graph as an **append-only log of CBOR frames**. The logical graph is the
*fold* (replay) of the log. Growth is an append; "deletion" is **suppression**, never a
physical removal; optimisation is a separate, explicitly **lossy** compaction that rewrites
the log into a snapshot.

Four properties define the format:

1. **CBOR all the way down** (RFC 8949). One ubiquitous, IETF-standardised binary encoding
   with native byte strings (no base64 tax), deterministic encoding (clean content hashes),
   and CBOR Sequences — concatenated data items with no enclosing length, so append is cheap. A
   reader needs only a CBOR library.
2. **A durable transform catalog.** Each frame's payload carries a *stackable* chain of
   codecs drawn from an open, long-lived catalog (`identity`, `base64`, `base85`, `gzip`,
   `zstd`, `lzma2`, `cose-encrypt`, …). The catalog separates *structure durability* (CBOR +
   this spec, forever) from *density and confidentiality* (swappable codecs).
3. **Integrity by construction.** Every frame carries an independent **BLAKE3 self-hash** (a
   content-id) and names its predecessor's id — a git-style content-addressed chain.
   Verification is **parallel**, a damaged frame is **independently detectable** (and the
   survivors recoverable given an intact index, §9.1), and the head id transitively commits to
   all history. Cryptographic signatures and encryption (COSE,
   RFC 9052) are optional, layered, and algorithm-agile.
4. **Recursive composition (matryoshka).** A payload, after its transforms are reversed, is
   just bytes — and a GTS file is just bytes. So a payload MAY itself be a complete GTS,
   wrapped in any transform (compressed *or* encrypted). A whole signed graph can ride inside
   an encrypted field, with its own independent header, chain, and signatures (§12.1).

**Non-goals.** GTS does not define a query language, an index format mandatory for reading,
a reasoner, or a mutation protocol. Random-access query, deep traversal, and SPARQL are the
job of a transform target, not of GTS.

**Informative motivation.** GTS keeps the baseline reader surface small: a reader needs CBOR,
BLAKE3, the mandatory codecs, and the fold rules rather than an RDF text parser. Tools that
need richer query, indexing, or analytics project the folded data to an operating substrate
such as N-Quads, SQLite, DuckDB, or Parquet.

## 2. Terminology and conformance

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHOULD**, **MAY**, and
**OPTIONAL** are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119, RFC 8174).

- **Log** — the ordered sequence of frames in a GTS file.
- **Frame** — one CBOR data item in the log (§6).
- **Fold** — the deterministic replay of the log into a graph state (§7.5).
- **Term** — an RDF term (IRI, literal, blank node, or quoted triple) with a stable integer id.
- **Reifier** — a term that denotes a quoted triple, carrying statement-level metadata (RDF 1.2).
- **Capability** — what a reader must hold to decode a payload: a *codec library* or a *key*.
- **Opaque node** — the graph representation of a frame the reader could not decode (§7.6).

### 2.1 Conformance scopes

This specification separates the following conformance scopes:

- **Wire-format conformance** covers the byte-level CBOR Sequence structure, deterministic-CBOR
  encoding, header and frame grammar, content-id preimages, and segment boundaries.
- **Reader conformance** covers parsing, chain verification, payload resolution, fold behavior,
  diagnostics, opaque-node handling, and resource-bound behavior.
- **Writer conformance** covers deterministic output, valid headers and frames, correct
  content identifiers, codec declarations, and signature/hash preimages.
- **Tool conformance** covers command-line or library policy that is stricter than local file
  validity, such as validating composition, extraction, publication, or archive operations.
- **Profile conformance** covers profile-specific vocabulary, validation, capability, and trust
  rules layered above the core format.
- **Deployment conformance** covers serving and distribution behavior such as media type,
  caching, range requests, and byte-preservation across HTTP or artifact hosting.

The conformance classes below define reader and writer behavior. Tool, profile, and deployment
requirements are scoped explicitly in the sections that define them.

### 2.2 Reader and writer conformance classes

- A **Baseline Reader** MUST: parse the CBOR sequence; verify the id/prev chain (§9.1); fold `terms`,
  `quads`, `reifies`, `annot`, `blob`, `suppress`, `meta`, and `snapshot` frames; support the
  `identity`, `gzip`, and `zstd` codecs; and surface any frame it cannot decode as an opaque
  node (§7.6). It MAY ignore signatures and encryption.
- A **Streaming Reader** is a Baseline Reader that processes frames one at a time and emits to a
  sink **without materialising the whole graph**: it maintains only the term dictionary (and a
  running chain check), giving O(distinct-terms) memory rather than O(triples) (§7.7). The
  `gts → duckdb`/`sqlite` transforms (§14) are Streaming Readers and run in bounded memory.
- A **Full Reader** additionally verifies COSE signatures, decrypts COSE-encrypted frames for
  which it holds keys, MAY recurse into nested GTS blobs (§12.1), and MAY use the optional index
  frame (§6.2) for parallel verification and random access.
- A **Writer** MUST emit deterministic CBOR (§4) for any bytes that are hashed or signed, and
  MUST compute each frame's `"id"` self-hash and set `"prev"` to the previous item's `"id"`.

### 2.3 Baseline reader API shape

A Baseline Reader SHOULD expose at least:

```text
open(bytes|path)            -> Graph          # parse + verify chain + fold
Graph.quads()               -> iterator[(s,p,o,g)]   # term ids resolved to terms
Graph.term(id)              -> Term
Graph.annotations(reifier)  -> iterator[(prop, value)]
Graph.blob(digest)          -> bytes | OpaqueRef
Graph.opaque()              -> iterator[OpaqueNode]
Graph.to_nquads(out)        # §14
```

This API shape is intentionally small: it exposes the folded tables, diagnostics, and common
projection path without requiring an RDF text parser, prefix resolver, query engine, or reasoner.

### 2.4 Reader diagnostics

Readers surface machine-observable diagnostics with these canonical classes (an implementation
MAY map them to error returns or structured warnings):

| class | meaning |
|---|---|
| `TornAppendError` | trailing incomplete CBOR item at EOF (§3) |
| `DamagedFrame` | self-`"id"` mismatch / invalid frame hash (content corruption); opaque `reason:"damaged"` (§7.6) |
| `BrokenChain` | valid frame hash, but `"prev"` ≠ the previous item's `"id"` (insertion / reorder / splice) (§9.1) |
| `TruncatedLog` | a head commitment is present but the observed head differs (§9, §18) |
| `UnknownCodec` | a transform names a codec the reader lacks; opaque `reason:"unknown-codec"` |
| `MissingKey` | an `encrypt` codec the reader cannot decrypt; opaque `reason:"missing-key"` |
| `ConflictingReifier` | a reifier rebound to a different triple (§7.8) |
| `RecursionLimit` | nested-GTS depth or decoded-size budget exceeded (§12.1, §18) |
| `StreamableLayoutError` | a segment claims `"layout": "streamable"` but its covered region violates delivery ordering, or its index footer is missing or contradicts the frames it covers (§3.3) |

## 3. File structure

A GTS file is a **CBOR Sequence** (RFC 8742): zero framing bytes between items, each item a
well-formed CBOR data item. The file MAY begin with the CBOR self-describe tag `55799`
(`0xd9 0xd9 0xf7`) as a magic number. If present, tag `55799` MUST tag the **Header** data item;
it is not a separate log item, has no `"id"`, and does not participate in the id/prev chain.

```text
GTS-file = segment *segment
segment  = [self-describe-tag] header *frame
```

- The **first** data item of a segment MUST be a **Header** (§5).
- Every subsequent data item of a segment is a **Frame** (§6), in log order, until the next
  Header (which begins a new segment) or end of input.
- **Append** = concatenate one more frame (extending the last segment), or concatenate a whole
  further segment (§3.1). No length prefix or count is stored, so a writer never rewrites
  earlier bytes.

### 3.1 Multi-segment files (`cat`-append composition)

A GTS file is one or more **segments**, each a complete, self-contained
`header *frame` log. The defining property: **byte-concatenation of valid GTS files is a
valid GTS file** —

```sh
cat music.gts >> core.gts        # core.gts is now a valid two-segment GTS
```

- **Boundary detection (normative).** A reader that has consumed at least one frame and
  encounters a data item that is a map containing the key `"gts"` and lacking the key `"t"`
  MUST treat it as the Header of a **new segment** (the optional self-describe tag `55799`
  MAY precede it; writers SHOULD emit the tag on every segment header to make boundaries
  human-recognizable). Any other non-frame item remains malformed input (§17).
- **Independent integrity.** Each segment has its own genesis (its header `"id"`), its own
  id/prev chain, its own signatures, and its own optional `index` (an index covers ONLY its
  segment). The file's composite identity is the **ordered list of segment head ids**. A
  third-party segment carries its own signer; concatenation rewrites nothing (a `cat` cannot
  rewrite an earlier segment's header without breaking its self-hash — by design).
- **Identity across segments.** Term-ids are **segment-scoped** (§7.2); the ONLY cross-segment
  identity is the term **value** (IRI, literal, quoted-triple structure). Blank-node labels are
  segment-local and MUST NOT be merged across segments (the §12.1 nested-GTS rule, applied at
  the top level).
- **Profiles union.** The file's effective profile/requirement set is the union of the segment
  headers' `"prof"` values (and any profile requirements carried in segment metadata). A reader
  lacking the capabilities a segment requires degrades that segment's frames to opaque nodes
  (§7.6) — "this data needs the gmeow-music profile" is a header read, not an error.
- **Relationship to nesting.** Nested GTS (§12.1) composes by *containment* (a sealed,
  independently-shippable subgraph); segments compose by *concatenation* (open, tool-free
  aggregation). Both yield a union fold; choose nesting when the part must travel or seal
  independently, segments when plain `cat` must work.

### 3.2 Streaming and progressive enhancement

The append-only log makes streaming a **property of the format**, not a feature of a tool.
Three facts compose, and conformant implementations MUST preserve all three:

- **Prefix-fold validity (normative).** Every byte prefix of a valid GTS file that ends on a
  data-item boundary is itself a valid GTS file, and a reader MUST fold it to exactly the
  state it would reach folding those same items inside the complete file. A live stream in
  flight is therefore *indistinguishable* from a file with a torn append (§3): the partial
  trailing item means "not yet arrived", and a consumer MAY keep reading as bytes land
  (`tail -f` semantics) — every intermediate fold is a real, usable graph state, never a
  half-parsed error state.
- **Monotone refinement.** Appended frames only ever *add* knowledge: quads accumulate
  (§7.8 set semantics), a reifier binding is first-wins so an established rendering never
  changes under it, and suppression is an additive display overlay (§11) — arrival of a
  `suppress` frame refines presentation without invalidating any prior fold. The chain check
  is likewise incremental: O(1) state (the expected `"prev"`) verifies each frame as it
  arrives.
- **Chunk-safe framing.** CBOR Sequence items are self-delimiting, so item boundaries are
  safe re-chunking points for relays and proxies, and resumption is content-addressed: a
  receiver that states the last frame `"id"` it verified can be resumed from the next byte
  with no negotiation beyond that hash.

**Progressive enhancement.** Producers SHOULD order content most-significant-first so an
early prefix is maximally useful: within a segment, `terms`/`quads` (the graph) before bulky
`blob` frames, and small or preview manifestations before large ones; across a file, segments
ARE the enhancement layers — a base segment (core graph + thumbnails) followed by enhancement
segments (full-resolution blobs, computed projections) gives a receiver a complete, verifiable
package at every segment boundary, §3.1's composition rules applied as a delivery schedule.
**Checkpoint `index` frames** (§6.2) emitted periodically give a streaming consumer
intermediate truncation anchors (`"head"`), random-access offsets for ranged re-fetch, and a
manifest of what has arrived; the index remains an accelerator, never a dependency (§3, §6.2).

**The manifest is the graph.** GTS needs no table-of-contents structure, because the frames
that *describe* content can precede the frames that *carry* it: a producer SHOULD emit the
quads naming each upcoming manifestation — its content digest, media type, size, role —
before the `blob` frames whose bytes they promise. The fold of an early prefix then contains
the delivery schedule as ordinary knowledge: every digest the graph names but the stream has
not yet delivered is a content-addressed IOU, so "stop here", "skip ahead" and "range-fetch
only the RAW file" are *informed* consumer decisions, taken against a verifiable catalog
rather than a guess. (A blob that never arrives in this file is simply an external blob, §12
— the reference degrades gracefully to "bytes live elsewhere".)

*Worked delivery schedule* — a photograph as a progressive stream; a consumer may stop at any
item boundary with a complete, verified package of everything above its stopping point:

```text
header                          profile, codec catalog
terms/quads                     the catalog: Work + every manifestation below,
                                each with digest, mt, size, role (the IOUs)
blob  image/webp        ~20 KB  thumbnail — first paint
blob  image/jxl         ~8 MB   full-resolution render
terms/quads                     scene description (what is IN the image)
blob  image/x-raw       ~80 MB  RAW sensor dump
meta/quads                      full camera metadata
terms/quads/annot               AI analysis as RDF, statement-level provenance
terms/quads/annot               opinions — standpoint-qualified claims
terms/quads                     processing-pipeline provenance
index                           footer: offsets, head anchor, MMR (§6.2)
```

A casual viewer stops after the thumbnail; an archivist takes everything; an editor
range-fetches the RAW by digest after reading only the catalog. Same bytes, same chain,
three consumers.

A reader streams items until end of input. Trailing partial bytes (a torn append) MUST be
detected and ignored with a diagnostic: a reader attempts to decode each successive CBOR item,
and if the decoder signals an incomplete item or unexpected EOF at end-of-file, it MUST treat
the trailing bytes as a torn append, ignore that incomplete item, and surface a
machine-observable diagnostic (e.g. a `TornAppendError` warning). In particular, if a crash
occurred while writing an `index` frame (§6.2) the trailing index is torn: a reader MUST ignore
it and fall back to an earlier intact `index` or to a plain **sequential scan**, so every
surviving frame remains recoverable. The optional index is an accelerator, never a dependency.

Every property above holds for any frame order; what a producer *chooses* as the order is a
separate, named concern: a segment is in one of two **layout states** — **accretive**
(append-ordered) or **streamable** (delivery-ordered) — defined next (§3.3).

### 3.3 Layout states: accretive and streamable

A GTS segment is always valid and always prefix-foldable (§3.2), but it lives in one of two
layout states:

- **Accretive** — append-optimized. Frames land in arrival order (live capture, agent memory
  accrual, evidence accrual). Writes are cheap forever and the stream is consumable as it
  lands, but significance is not front-loaded and the catalog may trail the bytes it
  describes. This is the default state; it is never declared.
- **Streamable** — delivery-ordered. The catalog *presages* the payload: a **leading streaming
  index** (ordinary `terms`/`quads` frames in the `stream` vocabulary, §13.3 — one
  `stream:Manifestation` per promised blob, carrying digest, media type, size, role, and
  intended order) precedes every `blob` frame, blobs follow most-significant-first, and a
  trailing offset `index` (§6.2) closes the covered region as the random-access footer.

Append-friendly and stream-optimal are different *layouts of the same content* (precedent:
mp4 `faststart`, zip central-directory rewrites, LSM compaction). A one-pass writer cannot
produce the second state, so conversion is an explicit rewrite — **streamable compaction**
(§10.1), exposed as `gts compact --streamable` (§14.1).

**The claim (normative).** A segment declares the streamable state with the optional header
key `"layout": "streamable"` (§5). The claim is per-segment (each segment has its own header,
§3.1) and tamper-evident (the header self-hash covers it). Streamability is a
**declared-vs-computed claim** in the sense of §14.1 — refuse-don't-trust:

- The **covered region** of a claimed segment is the prefix delimited by the segment's **last
  intact `index` frame**: `"count"` frames, ending at the frame whose `"id"` equals the
  index's `"head"`. The footer MUST immediately follow the frames it covers (`"count"` =
  the index's own frame position − 1) — otherwise frames could sit between the covered
  prefix and the footer, counted neither as covered nor as accretive tail. A claimed
  segment with no intact `index` frame, whose last index is not immediately adjacent to
  its covered prefix, or whose `"head"` does not equal the id of frame `"count"`, is in
  violation.
- Within the covered region, every inline `blob` frame MUST be preceded by a `quads` frame
  that describes its digest via `stream:digest` (§13.3) — catalog-before-payload. A covered
  blob delivered before its description is in violation.
- A reader encountering a violation MUST surface a **`StreamableLayoutError`** diagnostic
  (§2.3); a verifying tool treats it as an error (§14.1). The claim can never rot against
  the bytes.

**Appends after compaction are legal and foldable.** Frames after the last `index` are simply
*unpresaged*: they are the segment's **accretive tail**, carry no ordering obligation, and
trigger no diagnostic. The segment is then "streamable through frame *N*, accretive after" —
tooling SHOULD report the boundary (§14.1). Re-compact to re-streamline. Likewise, a segment
appended by `cat` makes no claim unless its own header claims.

**In-flight prefixes.** A prefix of a streamable segment cut before the trailing `index` has,
by construction, a claim and no footer yet; a streaming consumer MUST NOT treat the missing
footer as a lie while input may still be arriving — the missing-footer violation applies to a
*complete* file. The catalog-before-payload rule, by contrast, is prefix-stable: a violation
observed in any prefix is a violation of the whole file.

## 4. CBOR conventions

- Maps use **short text-string keys** (e.g. `"t"`, `"d"`) for self-description and eyeball
  debuggability; compactness is the transform layer's job, not the schema's.
- Any bytes that are **hashed or signed** MUST use **Deterministic Encoding** (RFC 8949 §4.2):
  shortest-form integers, definite-length items, and map keys sorted **bytewise on their
  encoded form** — explicitly the RFC 8949 rule, NOT RFC 7049's length-first canonical
  ordering. (For the short text keys GTS itself uses the two coincide, because a CBOR text
  string's initial byte embeds its length; the rules diverge on mixed-type keys, so
  implementations MUST NOT rely on a CBOR library's legacy "canonical" mode without checking
  which ordering it implements.)
- Unsigned integers are used for all ids. BLAKE3 digests are 32-byte (256-bit) byte strings.
- The grammar below is given in **CDDL** (RFC 8610).

```cddl
term-id      = uint            ; append-order, frozen (§7.2)
digest       = bstr .size 32   ; BLAKE3-256
content-id   = digest          ; a frame's self-hash (§9.1)
codec-id     = uint            ; index into the header codec catalog (§8)
```

## 5. Header

The Header is the first data item and the chain genesis; it is not a frame (it has no `"prev"`).

```cddl
header = {
  "gts"  : "GTS1",                    ; magic / format id
  "v"    : uint,                      ; spec major version (1)
  "prof" : tstr,                      ; profile (§13); "generic" if unspecified
  "cat"  : { * codec-id => codec },   ; the transform catalog (§8)
  ? "layout": tstr,                   ; layout-state claim (§3.3); absent = accretive
  ? "dct": { * tstr => bstr },        ; named, UNCOMPRESSED dictionaries for dict-codecs
  ? "meta": any,                      ; free-form, non-normative metadata
  "id"   : content-id,                ; self-hash of the header content (the chain genesis)
}

codec = {
  "name" : tstr,                      ; "identity" | "gzip" | "zstd" | "lzma2" | "cose-encrypt" | ...
  "cls"  : "encode" / "compress" / "encrypt",
  ? "dct": tstr,                      ; references header "dct" key (dict codecs)
  ? "p"  : any,                       ; codec parameters (e.g. lzma2 level)
}
```

The catalog is **closed within a file** (a frame may only reference codec-ids the header
declares) but **open across the ecosystem** (new codecs may be registered by name). The
Header carries its own `"id"` (self-hash of its content) and no `"prev"` — it is the genesis,
and the first frame's `"prev"` is the Header's `"id"`. The Header `"id"` MUST equal the
BLAKE3-256 of the deterministic CBOR of the Header map **excluding the `"id"` key**; all other
keys (including `"meta"`) participate. The optional `"layout"` key claims a layout state
(§3.3): the only value defined by this revision is `"streamable"`, which a verifying reader
MUST check against the segment's actual layout; readers MUST ignore unknown `"layout"` values
(forward compatibility — an unknown state imposes no check). Dictionaries are stored **uncompressed
and in-band** — there is no external-dictionary dependency. A codec's `"dct"` value MUST match
a key in the header `"dct"` map, and the codec MUST use the corresponding byte string as its
compression/encoding dictionary.

## 6. Frames

All frames share one envelope:

```cddl
frame = {
  "t"   : frame-type,        ; discriminator
  ? "x" : [+ codec-id],      ; transform chain, applied in order on encode; default [identity]
  ? "pub": any,              ; CLEARTEXT public envelope (always readable; §9.4)
  ? "to": [+ recipient],     ; recipients, for encrypt-class chains
  ? "d" : bstr / any,        ; payload: bstr when "x" transforms it; structured CBOR otherwise
  "prev": content-id,        ; the PREVIOUS data item's "id" (chain link; §9.1)
  "id"  : content-id,        ; BLAKE3-256 self-hash of this frame's CONTENT (all keys but "id"/"sig")
    ? "sig": bstr,           ; COSE_Sign1 over "id" (§9.2)
}

frame-type = "terms" / "quads" / "reifies" / "annot" / "blob" / "suppress"
           / "snapshot" / "meta" / "index" / "opaque"

recipient = { "kid": tstr, ? "alg": tstr, * tstr => any }   ; key identifier; never the key
```

Each frame's `"id"` MUST equal the BLAKE3-256 of the deterministic CBOR of its content (every
key except `"id"` and `"sig"`). Each frame's `"prev"` MUST equal the previous data item's
`"id"`; the **first** frame's `"prev"` is the Header's `"id"`. Because `"prev"` is inside the
hashed content, each `"id"` transitively commits to all prior frames (§9.1).

### 6.1 Payload resolution

To obtain a frame's logical payload:

1. If `"x"` is absent, the payload is `"d"` directly (structured CBOR) — equivalent to a single
   `identity` transform; a chain resolving to only `identity` likewise leaves `"d"` unchanged.
2. If `"x"` is present, `"d"` MUST be a byte string and every codec-id MUST resolve through the
   header `"cat"`; apply the **reverse** of each codec, last to first. Each step requires a
   **capability** (§8.3). On any missing capability (unknown codec or missing key), stop and
   treat the frame as **opaque** (§7.6).
3. The fully-decoded bytes are a CBOR item; decode them to the type-specific structure (§7).

### 6.2 Index frame (optional)

A writer MAY append an `index` frame — a footer that accelerates large files without raising
the simple-reader floor (a Baseline Reader ignores it). Because the log is append-only, a fresh
`index` MAY be appended after more frames; the **last** `index` wins.

```cddl
index-payload = {
  "count"  : uint,                        ; frames covered
  "head"   : content-id,                  ; "id" of the last covered frame (truncation anchor)
  ? "off"  : [+ uint],                    ; byte offset of each frame (random access; parallel verify)
  ? "ti"   : { * frame-type => [+ uint] },; frame indices by type
  ? "dict" : [+ uint],                    ; indices of "terms" frames (dictionary locator; §7.7)
  ? "mmr"  : content-id,                  ; Merkle-Mountain-Range root over frame ids (§9.1)
}
```

Given `"off"`, a Full Reader dispatches frame-hash verification across threads and seeks to any
frame; given `"dict"`, a Streaming Reader loads only the dictionary (§7.7); given `"head"`/
`"mmr"`, it detects truncation and produces O(log n) inclusion proofs. A **checkpoint** index is
simply an `index` emitted periodically rather than only as a footer; an earlier `index` MAY still
serve as a recovery anchor even though the last intact `index` is preferred for acceleration.

## 7. Graph data model and fold

The folded graph is four tables built from the log.

### 7.1 Terms (`terms` frame)

Payload: an **ordered array** of terms. Ids are assigned by append order across the whole log.

```cddl
terms-payload = [+ term]
term = {
  "k"   : 0 / 1 / 2 / 3,   ; 0=IRI 1=literal 2=bnode 3=quoted-triple
  ? "v" : tstr,            ; IRI string | literal lexical form | bnode label
  ? "dt": term-id,         ; literal datatype IRI (a term)
  ? "l" : tstr,            ; literal language tag (BCP 47)
  ? "rf": term-id,         ; quoted-triple: the reifier (§7.3) whose triple this term denotes
}
```

**Literal datatype defaulting (normative).** For a `k:1` (literal) term: if `"l"` (language
tag) is present and `"dt"` is absent, the datatype is `rdf:langString`; if both `"l"` and
`"dt"` are absent, the datatype is `xsd:string`.

**Blank-node labels (normative).** A `k:2` (blank node) term's `"v"` label is **local to the
GTS file** and MUST NOT be treated as a globally stable identifier; transforms MAY relabel blank
nodes while preserving blank-node isomorphism.

### 7.2 Term-id assignment (normative)

Term ids are unsigned integers assigned **in append order, per segment**, starting at `0` at
each segment's header, and are **frozen within their segment**: a term minted while folding
frame *N* keeps its id for the rest of that segment. A `quads`, `annot`, or `reifies` frame at
position *N* MUST only reference term-ids introduced at positions `0..N-1` **of the same
segment** (such frames introduce no terms of their own). This makes writing pure-append,
reading single-pass, and concatenation sound: term-ids are **compression artifacts, never
identity** — cross-segment identity is the term *value* only (§3.1), exactly as a `snapshot`'s
dictionary already restarts at `0` (§10). An implementation that applied file-global ids to a
multi-segment file would misfold silently; the boundary rule (§3.1) and vector 17 (§19) exist
to make that failure loud instead.

### 7.3 Quoted triples and reifiers (`reifies` frame)

RDF 1.2 lets a triple be the subject or object of another. GTS keeps quoted triples in the
id domain: a **reifier** is an ordinary IRI/bnode term; a `reifies` frame binds it to the
triple it quotes.

```cddl
reifies-payload = { * term-id => [term-id, term-id, term-id] }  ; reifier => (s, p, o)
```

A quoted triple used as a node is a term with `"k": 3` and `"rf"` pointing at its reifier.

**RDF 1.2 mapping (normative).** A `reifies` binding `R => (S,P,O)` means the triple
`R rdf:reifies <<( S P O )>>`; a `k:3` term denotes that triple term, reached through its
reifier `R`; and each `annot` row `(R, P', V')` is the triple `R P' V'`. **Quotation does not
imply assertion:** referencing a triple term (via a reifier or a `k:3` term) does NOT assert the
base triple `(S P O)`. The base triple is asserted iff it also appears in a `quads` frame.

### 7.4 Quads and annotations

```cddl
quads-payload = [+ [term-id, term-id, term-id, ? term-id]]  ; s, p, o, (g; default graph if absent)
annot-payload = [+ [term-id, term-id, term-id]]             ; reifier, predicate, value
```

Statement-level metadata (confidence, validity interval, standpoint/vantage, modality, …) is
expressed as `annot` rows on a reifier. **Contested claims coexist**: several `annot` rows on
one reifier, or several reifiers over one (s,p,o), are all retained — none is privileged.

**Position constraints (normative).** In a `quads` row the predicate `p` MUST be an IRI (`k:0`);
the subject `s` MUST be an IRI, blank node, or quoted triple (`k:0|2|3`); the object `o` MAY be
any term; and the graph name `g`, when present, MUST be an IRI or blank node (`k:0|2`) — never a
literal or quoted triple. A `reifies` triple `(S,P,O)` obeys the same subject/predicate/object
constraints. In an `annot` row the predicate MUST be an IRI.

### 7.5 Fold algorithm (normative)

```text
result := empty union state (graph, reif, annot, blobs, meta, suppressed, opaque[])
for segment in file order:                      # §3.1; single-segment files: one iteration
  verify each frame's id (self-hash) and prev-link within the segment;
  record sig status if "sig" present
  terms := []   graph := {}   reif := {}   meta := {}   blobs := {}   suppressed := {}
  for frame in segment log order:
    P := resolve payload (§6.1); if undecodable -> add opaque node (§7.6); continue
    switch frame.t:
      "terms"    : append each term (assign next id); each "dt"/"rf" MUST name an
                   already-introduced term-id (no forward references)
      "quads"    : add each (s,p,o,g) to graph
      "reifies"  : reif[reifier] := (s,p,o)
      "annot"    : record (reifier, predicate, value)
      "blob"     : if "d" present -> blobs[BLAKE3(decoded "d")] := bytes (inline);
                   else -> register external blob by "pub".digest
      "suppress" : mark referenced subgraph/frame in `suppressed` (display contract; §11)
      "snapshot" : load a self-contained fold wholesale (§10)
      "meta"     : shallow-merge map into global meta (later keys overwrite earlier)
      "opaque"   : add explicit opaque node
  union segment fold into result BY TERM VALUE     # ids resolve locally, never cross segments;
                                                   # bnode labels stay segment-local (§3.1)
result
```

The fold is deterministic: the same log yields the same graph in every conformant reader.
Within a segment, `meta` accumulates as a shallow union over one map — a later frame's keys
replace earlier ones; values are not concatenated. **Across segments**, each segment's folded
`meta` is exposed per segment (keyed by segment head id) AND shallow-merged in file order into
a file-level view — a later segment's keys win, but the per-segment originals remain
addressable (a third-party segment's metadata is never silently absorbed).

### 7.6 Opaque nodes

When a frame's payload cannot be decoded — an unknown codec, or a `cose-encrypt` codec for
which the reader holds no key — the reader MUST NOT drop it. It MUST add an **opaque node** to
the graph carrying everything still in cleartext:

```cddl
opaque-node = {
  "id"      : content-id,      ; the frame's self-hash
  "type"    : frame-type,      ; declared "t"
  ? "pub"   : any,             ; the cleartext public envelope, if any
  ? "to"    : [+ recipient],   ; declared recipients
  "sigstat" : "none" / "valid" / "invalid" / "unverified",
  "reason"  : "unknown-codec" / "missing-key" / "damaged",
}
```

Most opaque nodes are produced by a reader at decode time; a writer MAY also emit an explicit
`opaque` frame (e.g. a redaction placeholder) whose payload is the structure above, in which
case `"sigstat"` is omitted (a reader determines it). A `damaged` frame (failed self-hash, or
absent) is isolated and folded as an opaque node too (§9.1): a reader MAY surface its cleartext
fields as **untrusted** diagnostic metadata, but MUST set `"sigstat"` to `invalid`/`unverified`
and `"reason": "damaged"` — the bytes are not trustworthy. The frame still participates in the
id/prev chain, so it cannot be silently stripped.

### 7.7 Streaming fold and bounded memory

A graph need not be materialised to be *transformed*. A **Streaming Reader** (§2.1) processes
frames in order and emits to a sink, holding only the term dictionary and the running id/prev
check:

- `gts → duckdb`/`sqlite` (§14) keep the **integer-id** model: stream `terms` deltas into a
  `terms` table and `quads`/`reifies`/`annot` deltas into id-valued tables, bulk-inserting as
  frames arrive. **No term resolution and no graph materialisation occur** — memory is O(1)
  beyond the dictionary, and the dictionary is O(distinct-terms) ≪ O(triples). The relational
  join that resolves ids is the engine's job, later.
- `gts → ttl/nq` must resolve ids to emit text. If the dictionary exceeds memory, the reader
  uses the index `"dict"` locator (§6.2) to load (or memory-map, or spill to an on-disk kv)
  only the `terms` frames first, then streams the quads.

Even O(distinct-terms) can exceed memory for pathologically irregular graphs (e.g. a crawl
dumping millions of unique UUID IRIs). A Streaming Reader therefore MAY **flush its in-memory
dictionary to a temporary on-disk key-value store** when a memory limit is reached, trading RAM
for a local spill file; correctness is unaffected because term-ids are append-order and frozen
(§7.2). The `gts → duckdb`/`sqlite` transforms get this for free — the target table *is* the
spill.

A multi-gigabyte log thus transforms to an operating substrate in bounded memory — the
resolve-and-materialise OOM failure mode is avoided by construction.

### 7.8 Duplicates and conflicts (normative)

- **Duplicate terms.** A writer SHOULD intern terms, but if two term entries are byte-identical
  they denote the **same RDF term** (each still gets its own id); resolution is unaffected.
- **Duplicate quads.** The folded graph is a **set**: identical `(s,p,o,g)` rows collapse to one.
- **Reifier bindings.** A reifier SHOULD have exactly one `reifies` binding. Repeated bindings
  for the same reifier MUST be identical; a **conflicting** binding is a data-quality error — the
  reader surfaces a diagnostic and keeps the first binding.
- **Annotations.** Multiple `annot` rows on a reifier coexist (contested claims, §7.4); they are
  not deduplicated beyond exact-row identity.

## 8. Transform catalog

### 8.1 Classes

Every catalog entry declares a **class**:

| class      | examples                         | capability needed to reverse |
|------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `encode`   | `identity`, `base64`, `base85`   | none (pure function)         |
| `compress` | `gzip`, `zstd`, `lzma2`          | a codec library              |
| `encrypt`  | `cose-encrypt0`, `cose-encrypt`  | a **key** (per recipient)    |

### 8.2 Stacking

`"x"` is applied in array order on encode and reversed on decode. Example: `[zstd,
cose-encrypt]` means *compress, then encrypt*; a reader decrypts (if keyed) then decompresses.

### 8.3 Capability model and graceful degradation

Decoding a chain requires **every** capability it names. A missing capability is uniform
whether it is a library (`unknown-codec`) or a key (`missing-key`): the frame becomes an
opaque node (§7.6). This single mechanism yields **in-file content negotiation** — a logical
object MAY appear as several frames in different codecs/formats (e.g. a high-fidelity
representation a reader can't decode *and* a widely-supported fallback it can), and the reader
uses the best frame for which it holds the capabilities.

### 8.4 Mandatory core set and durability

A Baseline Reader MUST implement `identity`, `gzip`, and `zstd` — so a conformant reader's full
dependency set is **CBOR + BLAKE3 + gzip + zstd**. Writers targeting maximum longevity SHOULD
restrict to the core set. Density-oriented writers MAY use `lzma2` with an in-band dictionary.
All core codecs are stable, widely deployed primitives.

**Rsyncable codecs.** A `compress`-class codec MAY be *rsyncable*: it periodically
synchronizes (resets) its compression state so that a local change in the
uncompressed input only affects a bounded neighborhood of the compressed
output. This improves delta-transfer tools (e.g. `rsync`) and version-control
delta compression (e.g. Git packfiles) at the cost of a small compression-ratio
overhead. The only rsyncable codec defined in this revision is `zstd-rsyncable`
(§8.5).

### 8.5 Canonical codec registry (v1)

Catalog entries are referenced by integer id within a file (§5), but each entry's `"name"` MUST
be a canonical identifier from this registry so writers interoperate:

| name            | cls        | baseline? | parameters                    |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| `identity`      | `encode`   | yes       | none                          |
| `gzip`          | `compress` | yes       | `level`?                      |
| `zstd`          | `compress` | yes       | `level`?, `window`?, `dct`?   |
| `zstd-rsyncable`| `compress` | no        | `block_size`: uint (default 65536) |
| `lzma2`         | `compress` | no        | `level`?, `dct`?              |
| `base64url`     | `encode`   | no        | none (unpadded)               |
| `base85`        | `encode`   | no        | none                          |
| `cose-encrypt0` | `encrypt`  | no        | `COSE_Encrypt0` (1 recipient) |
| `cose-encrypt`  | `encrypt`  | no        | `COSE_Encrypt` (n recipients) |

A reader MUST match codecs by canonical `"name"`, not by catalog id (ids are file-local). Later
spec versions register new codecs by canonical name; an unknown name degrades to an opaque node
(§8.3).

## 9. Integrity and confidentiality

GTS keeps four integrity concerns distinct:

1. **Frame integrity** — the per-frame BLAKE3 self-hash `"id"` (§9.1).
2. **History integrity** — the `"prev"` content-id chain (§9.1).
3. **Origin / authorship** — optional COSE signatures (§9.2).
4. **Freshness / non-truncation** — a head commitment: a signature over the head `"id"`, or an
   index `"mmr"`/`"head"` root (§9.1, §13).

The first two are mandatory and key-free; the last two are optional and profile-driven.

### 9.1 Per-frame self-hash and content-id chain (mandatory)

Each frame's `"id"` is the BLAKE3-256 of its own content (every key except `"id"` and `"sig"`),
so a frame is **content-addressed and independently verifiable**. Each frame's `"prev"` names
the previous frame's `"id"`; because `"prev"` is part of the hashed content, the chain is a
git-style content-addressed list in which the **head id transitively commits to all history**.

- **Parallel verification.** Every `"id"` is a hash of a self-contained byte range; with the
  index `"off"` table (§6.2) all frame hashes are recomputed concurrently, followed by a trivial
  O(n) `"prev"`-equality pass. No accumulating dependency forces single-threaded reading. (The
  only inherently sequential step is discovering frame boundaries in a bare CBOR sequence — a
  cheap length-scan the index removes.)
- **Damage isolation and recovery.** A corrupt frame fails *its own* `"id"`, so damage is
  **independently detectable**. Recovery of *subsequent* frames, however, is guaranteed only
  when their byte offsets are known — from an intact `index` `"off"` table, a checkpoint frame,
  external framing, or the storage layer. In a bare CBOR Sequence (no per-frame length) arbitrary
  byte corruption can desynchronise the decoder: a reader **with** offsets skips the bad frame
  and folds the survivors (`reason: "damaged"`), while a reader **without** offsets MAY be unable
  to resynchronise past the damage. `evidence` writers SHOULD emit periodic checkpoint indexes
  (§13) so recovery is robust.
- **Tamper-evidence.** Any insertion, reordering, or mutation breaks a `"prev"` link or a self-
  hash. **Truncation** (dropping trailing frames) is detected only against a head commitment —
  a signature over the head `"id"`, the index `"head"`/`"mmr"` root (§6.2), or an out-of-band
  anchor. Opaque frames are part of the chain, so confidential frames cannot be stripped
  undetectably.

A **Merkle-Mountain-Range** (MMR) root over the frame ids (optional, carried in the index) is a
single whole-file commitment that is itself parallel to compute and supports O(log n) inclusion
proofs — proving a frame is in the log without shipping the log.

### 9.2 Signatures (optional, algorithm-agile)

A frame MAY carry `"sig"`, a `COSE_Sign1` (RFC 9052) over the frame's `"id"`. Because `"id"`
is the self-hash of the whole content — `"pub"`, `"d"` (the ciphertext, if encrypted), and
`"prev"` (the chain position) — one signature over `"id"` **binds** the public claims to the
sealed payload and to the chain position, and signing the head `"id"` thereby anchors all prior
history (§9.1). The signing algorithm is declared in the COSE header (e.g. `EdDSA`/Ed25519,
`ES256`); readers MUST honour the declared algorithm. The `evidence` and `opaque` profiles
(§13) REQUIRE signatures. Key discovery and trust anchoring (which keys are authentic, which
signers are authorised) are **profile/deployment policy**, not core GTS: `sigstat: "valid"`
means a signature is cryptographically valid under a *resolved* key, not that the key is trusted.

### 9.3 Encryption (optional)

An `encrypt`-class codec wraps the payload as `COSE_Encrypt`/`COSE_Encrypt0`. Recipients are
listed in cleartext `"to"` by **key identifier only** — never the key material. Multiple
recipients MAY share one sealed payload (each unwraps the content-encryption key with its own
key). Key escrow, rotation, and revocation are the **issuer's** responsibility and are out of
scope; a payload encrypted to a retired key MAY become permanently opaque.

### 9.4 The opacity invariant (normative)

> Opacity hides **content** — never **existence**, **provenance**, or **position**.

For every frame, `{"id", "prev", "t", "x", "to", "pub", "sig"}` MUST remain in cleartext (the
transform chain `"x"` is cleartext so a reader knows which codecs to reverse). A reader without
the relevant key therefore still learns *that* the frame exists, *what kind* it is, *who* it is
sealed for, *who* signed it, and *where* it sits in the chain. This is what makes selective
disclosure safe: a holder can carry — and a verifier can authenticate the position of — data
neither can read.

## 10. Compaction

Compaction folds a log and re-emits it as a single self-contained `snapshot` frame (re-interned
dictionary, deduplicated quads, dropped self-loops, optionally a materialised entailment
closure). A `snapshot`'s payload is a self-contained fold — the four tables plus inline blobs
and meta:

```cddl
snapshot-payload = {
  "terms"    : terms-payload,
  ? "quads"  : quads-payload,
  ? "reifies": reifies-payload,
  ? "annot"  : annot-payload,
  ? "blobs"  : { * digest => bstr },   ; inline content-addressed blobs
  ? "meta"   : any,
}
```

A reader folds a `snapshot` exactly as it would fold the equivalent sequence of `terms`/`quads`/
`reifies`/`annot`/`blob` frames; term-ids restart at `0` within the snapshot's own dictionary.
Compaction is **lossy by definition**: it discards the original per-frame signatures and the
temporal stacking of the log. A compactor:

- MUST record the provenance of the fold (source log digest, time, agent) as quads in the
  snapshot, and
- SHOULD emit a fresh signature over the snapshot.

Two artifact classes follow: an **evidentiary log** (append-only, signed, never compacted) and
a **distribution snapshot** (compacted, dense, lossy — ideal for shipping). A reader can tell
which it holds from the profile and the presence of a `snapshot` frame.

### 10.1 Streamable compaction (ordering-only)

Streamable compaction converts an accretive segment (or multi-segment file) into one
delivery-ordered segment in the streamable layout state (§3.3). Unlike snapshot compaction
above, it is **a re-authoring of the ORDERING, and only the ordering**: the folded graph,
the inline blobs, and every content-addressed fact are preserved. Three signature subjects
behave differently under the rewrite, and a compactor MUST honour all three:

- **Content signatures** (subject = a content digest: a blob's BLAKE3, a statement or claim
  hash — "this is true, signed by Bob") are ordinary quads/annotations about digests. They
  are **compaction-invariant** and survive fully intact: nothing they attest to has changed.
- **Frame signatures** (a COSE_Sign1 over a frame `"id"`, which commits to `"prev"`, §9.2)
  become **detached, not broken**: they verify against the original frame id forever. A
  compactor MUST carry every source frame signature in **compaction provenance** — one
  `stream:DetachedSignature` node per signature, recording the original frame id
  (`stream:sourceFrame`) and the original COSE bytes (`stream:cose`), plus one
  `stream:sourceHead` per source segment head (§13.3) — so each remains a *checkable claim
  about the original log*.
- **Ordering commitments** (a signed head, an index `"mmr"` root) are the only layout-bound
  attestations. They cannot survive a reordering; the compactor re-issues the ordering
  commitment (the new trailing `index` with its `"head"`, §6.2) and thereby becomes the
  **sole attester of the new ordering**. A compactor MAY additionally COSE-sign the new head.

A compactor MUST record the rewrite itself as provenance quads in the output — a
`stream:Compaction` node carrying the acting tool (`stream:agent`), the time
(`stream:timestamp`), and the source segment heads (`stream:sourceHead`) — the §10
provenance MUST, given concrete vocabulary by §13.3.

**Profiles demanding pristine third-party chain attestation.** For an `evidence` segment the
original signed chain *is* the artifact; a compactor MUST refuse it — unless it **seals the
original log verbatim** as a nested GTS blob (§12.1) inside the streamable rewrite (role
`"source"`, referenced from the provenance node via `stream:sealedSource`). The original
bytes, chain, and signatures stay byte-intact and independently verifiable inside; the outer
layout is delivery-ordered; one content digest binds them.

**Refusals for publication tools (§14.1).** A compactor MUST refuse: input that does not
verify cleanly (any diagnostic); and input whose fold carries a frame-addressed suppression
(`kind: "frame"`, §11) — the rewrite assigns new frame ids, so a frame-digest target would
silently dangle. Digest-addressed `blob` suppressions are carried forward verbatim
(content-addressing is layout-independent); id-addressed suppressions are carried forward
value-wise (§11).

## 11. Suppression (additive "deletion")

GTS never physically deletes. To retract or hide prior content, a writer appends a `suppress`
frame referencing the superseded subgraph or frame digest. The suppressed bytes remain present
and hash-linked; suppression is a **display/precedence contract**, interpreted by the consumer,
not an erasure. This preserves a complete, tamper-evident history.

```cddl
suppress-payload = { "targets": [+ suppress-target], ? "reason": tstr, ? "by": term-id }
suppress-target =
    { "kind": "frame",   "id": digest } /                                ; a frame, by its "id"
    { "kind": "blob",    "digest": digest } /                            ; a content-addressed blob
    { "kind": "term",    "id": term-id } /                               ; a term + quads it appears in
    { "kind": "quad",    "q": [term-id, term-id, term-id, ? term-id] } / ; one specific quad
    { "kind": "reifier", "id": term-id }                                 ; a reifier + its annotations
```

Suppression is **monotonic and additive**: a matched target is hidden from default resolution (a
`term` target also hides every quad in which the term appears); the bytes remain present and
hash-linked, and a consumer MAY surface suppressed content explicitly. There is no un-suppress in
v1 — later frames may add further suppressions, and a later identical assertion does not revive a
suppressed target.

**Cross-segment suppression (normative, §3.1).** Digest-addressed targets (`frame`, `blob`)
are file-global: a content-id names the same bytes wherever they sit, so a later segment MAY
suppress an earlier segment's frame or blob by digest. Id-addressed targets (`term`, `quad`,
`reifier`) carry term-ids, which are segment-local — they are first **resolved to term values
within the suppress frame's own segment**, and the suppression then applies **value-wise to the
whole union fold**: a `quad` target hides every matching `(s,p,o,g)` value tuple in any
segment, and a `term` target hides the term value (and the quads it appears in) file-wide.
This is what lets an appended belief-revision segment suppress a statement made by an earlier
segment without rewriting a byte of it — the earlier segment's record stays present, signed,
and hash-linked (content-addressed at the wire level).

## 12. Binary and content-addressing

```cddl
; a `blob` frame carries raw bytes in "d" (subject to "x"); its metadata lives in cleartext "pub":
blob-pub = { ? "mt": tstr, ? "rep": tstr, ? "digest": digest }
; INLINE blob  -> "d" present; digest = BLAKE3(decoded "d").
; EXTERNAL blob -> "d" absent;  "pub".digest names bytes held elsewhere.
```

- A `blob` frame's bytes are addressed by their **BLAKE3-256 digest** — for an inline blob the
  `BLAKE3` of the decoded `"d"`, for an external blob `"pub".digest`; the graph references the
  blob by that digest. Identical bytes appearing twice are stored once by convention.
- A blob MAY be **inline** (bytes present, a self-contained package) or **external** (only the
  digest appears in the graph; bytes live elsewhere).
- A logical object MAY have **multiple representations** (`"rep"`/`"mt"` distinguishing, e.g.,
  a master and a widely-supported fallback) — see content negotiation, §8.3.
- Transforming to a text format (§14) externalises inline blobs to a sidecar directory.

### 12.1 Nested GTS (recursive composition)

A blob whose media type is `application/gts` is itself a complete GTS file. Because a payload
after transform reversal is opaque bytes, **any** frame payload MAY carry a nested GTS, wrapped
in any transform chain — `[zstd]`, `[cose-encrypt]`, or both. The normative carrier is a `blob`
whose `"pub".mt` is `application/gts`.

- **Fold semantics.** A Full Reader MAY recurse: decode the blob (subject to §6.1 capability
  rules), then fold the inner bytes as an independent GTS, exposing its result as a **subgraph**
  the parent graph references by the blob's digest. A Baseline Reader MAY treat a nested GTS as
  an ordinary blob (no recursion).
- **Independent integrity.** The inner GTS has its own header, id/prev chain, and signatures. The
  **outer** chain proves the nested blob is present and intact at its position; the **inner**
  chain proves the nested log is intact. The two guarantees compose but do not depend on each
  other.
- **Composed opacity.** If the nested GTS is reached through an `encrypt`-class transform and
  the reader lacks the key, the *entire subgraph* — including its inner header — is an opaque
  node (§7.6): the holder can carry and prove the position of a whole sealed graph it cannot
  read. This is the matryoshka case ("a whole GTS inside an encrypted field").
- **Bounded recursion.** Readers MUST enforce a maximum nesting depth and total decoded-size
  budget (§18).

This composition needs no new frame type: nesting is "a blob that happens to be a GTS."

## 13. Profiles

A profile is a named set of conventions over the one format (declared in header `"prof"`):

| profile      | shape                                                                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `generic`    | any conformant log.                                                                |
| `dist`       | a single compacted `snapshot`: vocabulary + definitions + materialised closure.    |
| `evidence`   | append-only, signatures REQUIRED, **never compacted**; the file is a custody chain.|
| `image`      | a `blob` (or several representations) + descriptive metadata + analysis frames.    |
| `ai-package` | a concept + logic + observations + opinions + refuted claims + embeddings + data.  |
| `opaque`     | `encrypt`-class frames; signatures + pseudonymous `kid`s REQUIRED; selective disclosure. |
| `bundle`       | a GTS whose `blob`s are themselves GTS files (`mt: application/gts`); §12.1.        |
| `files`        | a GTS archive of file-tree entries: each file is a blob described by path, size, mode, mtime, and media type (§13.2). |
| `music-package`| a frame-relative musical work/expression: segments, voices, tuning/time frames, tone events, degrees of freedom, and analysis claims, plus lossy projections to notation formats (§13.4). |

Profiles constrain conventions, not the wire format; a `generic` reader reads them all. The
`evidence` profile additionally REQUIRES a head commitment (§9, item 4), and writers SHOULD emit
a checkpoint `index` at least every 1024 frames or 64 MiB, whichever comes first, so a damaged
log recovers robustly (§9.1). In a multi-segment file each segment declares its own profile;
the file's effective requirement set is the union (§3.1).

### 13.1 Language-tag discipline (normative)

A producer's graph payload MAY carry **internal private-use language tags** (e.g. GMEOW's
`x-gmeow-*`): the payload of a `dist` or `ai-package` segment *is* the canonical form, and
canonical forms keep their internal tags. Every **projection section** — docs blobs, derived
views, down-projected representations, anything generated *for an external consumer* — MUST
carry **public BCP 47 tags only**; a producer that leaks private-use tags into a projection
section MUST fail at write time, not warn (vector 20). The boundary is per *role*, not per
file: one package legitimately carries a canonical payload with internal tags beside
public-tagged docs sections. (This mirrors the GMEOW generator framework's internal-tag leak
gate; the reference producer reuses its `retag` machinery at the section boundary.)

### 13.2 The `files` profile (normative)

The `files` profile is a portable, content-addressed archive of a file tree. It is the GTS
answer to tar's `c`/`x`/`d`: pack a directory into a single-segment GTS, unpack it later, and
`diff` it against a directory without byte comparison.

**Namespace.** The profile owns a small, spec-defined vocabulary at
`https://w3id.org/gts/files#` (prefix `files`). GTS independence means an unpacker MUST NOT
require GMEOW, schema.org, or any other ontology to read the archive; the vocabulary is
authored in the spec and carried as literal IRIs in the graph.

| term | IRI | shape |
|---|---|---|
| `FileEntry` | `https://w3id.org/gts/files#FileEntry` | Class. One archived file. |
| `path` | `https://w3id.org/gts/files#path` | Relative path string, `/` separators, no leading `/`, no `..` components. |
| `digest` | `https://w3id.org/gts/files#digest` | `blake3:<hex>` content digest of the file bytes. |
| `size` | `https://w3id.org/gts/files#size` | Byte size as `xsd:integer`. |
| `mode` | `https://w3id.org/gts/files#mode` | POSIX file mode/permissions as `xsd:integer` (e.g. `0o100644`). |
| `modified` | `https://w3id.org/gts/files#modified` | Modification time as `xsd:dateTime` in UTC. |
| `mediaType` | `https://w3id.org/gts/files#mediaType` | Declared IANA media type string. |

**Quad shape.** Each file in the archive is described by one blank-node `FileEntry`:

```text
_:entry a files:FileEntry ;
    files:path "relative/path.txt" ;
    files:digest "blake3:<hex>" ;
    files:size 1234 ;
    files:mode 33204 ;
    files:modified "2026-06-10T20:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
    files:mediaType "text/plain" .
```

**Determinism.** A `files` archive MUST be byte-reproducible for the same input tree:

- Paths are sorted lexicographically by their UTF-8 byte sequence before emission.
- Modification times are normalised to UTC and serialised as `xsd:dateTime` with second
  precision (fractional seconds MAY be retained when present on the source).
- Only POSIX mode and mtime are recorded; ownership, uid/gid, xattrs, and ACLs are deliberately
  excluded — they are tar's portability tarpit.

**Inline and external blobs.** A file's bytes MAY be carried as an inline `blob` frame
(`"d"` present, digest = BLAKE3(decoded `"d")`) or as an external blob (`"d"` absent,
`pub.digest` names bytes held elsewhere, §12). By default all files are inline; a writer MAY
store files larger than a configured threshold externally by reference. Identical bytes
appearing under multiple paths are stored once by convention.

**Relationship to other vocabularies.** The profile is deliberately self-contained, but the
terms align by reference to common surface vocabularies: `files:size` ↔ schema.org
`contentSize`, `files:mediaType` ↔ schema.org `encodingFormat`, `files:modified` ↔ NFO
`fileLastModified`, `files:path` ↔ NFO `fileName`. These alignments live in GMEOW's mapping
DSL; the files profile itself does not depend on them.

### 13.3 The `stream` vocabulary (normative)

The streamable layout state (§3.3) and streamable compaction (§10.1) use a small,
spec-defined vocabulary at `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#` (prefix `stream`) — the same
independence decision as the `files` profile (§13.2): no GMEOW or external ontology is
required to stream a photo archive; the terms are authored here and carried as literal IRIs
in the graph. The vocabulary is deliberately distinct from `files#` (the two compose: a
`files` archive that is also streamable describes each file once as a `files:FileEntry` and
once as a `stream:Manifestation` — the profile check (§14.1) and the layout check (§3.3)
stay independent).

**Streaming-index terms** — one `stream:Manifestation` per promised blob, emitted in the
leading streaming index before any `blob` frame (§3.3):

| term | IRI | shape |
|---|---|---|
| `Manifestation` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#Manifestation` | Class. One blob this segment promises to deliver. |
| `digest` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#digest` | `blake3:<hex>` content digest — the IOU the blob redeems. |
| `mediaType` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#mediaType` | Declared IANA media type (mirrors the blob's `pub.mt`). |
| `size` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#size` | Byte size of the decoded blob as `xsd:integer`. |
| `role` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#role` | Delivery role string: `"preview"` / `"primary"` / `"source"`; open set. |
| `order` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#order` | Intended delivery position among the segment's blobs, `xsd:integer`, 0-based. |

**Compaction-provenance terms** — the concrete vocabulary for §10/§10.1's provenance MUST:

| term | IRI | shape |
|---|---|---|
| `Compaction` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#Compaction` | Class. One rewrite event (a blank node). |
| `agent` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#agent` | The acting tool, a string (e.g. `"gts-compact"`). |
| `timestamp` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#timestamp` | Rewrite time as `xsd:dateTime` in UTC. |
| `sourceHead` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#sourceHead` | `blake3:<hex>` head id of one source segment; repeated per segment. |
| `sealedSource` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#sealedSource` | `blake3:<hex>` digest of the nested-GTS blob holding the verbatim original (§10.1). |
| `DetachedSignature` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#DetachedSignature` | Class. One carried-over frame signature (a blank node). |
| `sourceFrame` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#sourceFrame` | `blake3:<hex>` original frame `"id"` the COSE signature verifies against, forever. |
| `cose` | `https://w3id.org/gts/stream#cose` | The original COSE_Sign1 bytes, base64url (unpadded) literal. |

**Quad shape** (a compacted segment's streaming index, then provenance):

```text
_:m0 a stream:Manifestation ;
    stream:digest "blake3:<hex>" ;
    stream:mediaType "image/webp" ;
    stream:size 20480 ;
    stream:role "primary" ;
    stream:order 0 .
_:c a stream:Compaction ;
    stream:agent "gts-compact" ;
    stream:timestamp "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
    stream:sourceHead "blake3:<hex>" .
_:s0 a stream:DetachedSignature ;
    stream:sourceFrame "blake3:<hex>" ;
    stream:cose "<base64url>" .
```

**Claim coupling (normative).** Use of `stream#` terms in a segment that does NOT claim
`"layout": "streamable"` is a **warning**, not an error (§14.1): provenance quads
legitimately survive `gts → nq → gts` round trips and re-accretion after appends. The error
class is reserved for the opposite rot — a claimed layout the bytes contradict (§3.3).

### 13.4 The `music-package` profile (normative)

The `music-package` profile is a single-segment GTS that carries frame-relative musical content:
a `MusicalWork`/`MusicalExpression`, its `Voice`s and `MusicalSegment`s, `TuningSystem` and
`MusicalTimeFrame` reference frames, atomic `ToneEvent`s, `DegreeOfFreedom` declarations, and
standpoint-indexed analysis claims. It is the canonical transport form for the GMEOW music slice
and the input to every notation projection.

**Namespace.** The profile reuses the GMEOW music vocabulary
(`https://blackcatinformatics.ca/gmeow/`). A `music-package` is not required to be a `dist`
profile: it may carry only the musical content graph plus any projection blobs, and it MAY rely on
an external `dist` snapshot for vocabulary definitions.

**Header.** A `music-package` segment declares `"prof": "music-package"`. The profile is
append-only for new claims; existing triples are never deleted, only superseded by statement-layer
provenance (§7.3).

**Core quad shape.** A minimal package contains:

```text
@prefix gmeow: <https://blackcatinformatics.ca/gmeow/> .
@prefix xsd:   <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:piece a gmeow:MusicalExpression ;
    gmeow:hasVoice :voice1 .

:voice1 a gmeow:Voice ;
    gmeow:voiceTuningFrame :tuning12EDO ;
    gmeow:voiceTimeFrame :timeGrid .

:tuning12EDO a gmeow:TuningSystem .
:timeGrid a gmeow:MusicalTimeFrame .

:event1 a gmeow:ToneEvent ;
    gmeow:segmentOf :voice1 ;
    gmeow:toneEventPitchValue :pitchC4 ;
    gmeow:segmentSpan :span1 .

:span1 a gmeow:MusicalTimeSpan ;
    gmeow:hasMusicalTimeFrame :timeGrid ;
    gmeow:timeStartNumerator 0 ;
    gmeow:timeStartDenominator 1 ;
    gmeow:timeDurationNumerator 1 ;
    gmeow:timeDurationDenominator 4 .
```

Time and pitch are **frame-relative**: `toneEventPitchValue` points to a
`PitchValue` interpreted under the event's voice tuning frame, and offsets/durations are rational
values interpreted under the voice time frame.

**Projections.** A `music-package` MAY contain `blob` frames whose bytes are down-projected
representations (MusicXML, MEI, ABC, LilyPond, Humdrum **kern, MIDI, Scala `.scl`, tablature,
mensural, graphic notation). Each projection MUST be accompanied by a declared-loss manifest that
lists the `NotationProjectionProfile` used, the `MusicalParameter`s it can represent, and the
`ProjectionLoss`es it incurs. The manifest is a Turtle sidecar or an embedded header/comment and
is considered part of the projection, not the canonical graph.

**Bundle profile coupling.** A `bundle` profile (§12.1) whose blobs are `music-package` segments
provides the multi-movement / multi-version transport case. Each nested segment keeps its own
profile declaration; the outer bundle does not impose additional conventions.

**Verification.** A conformant `gts verify` over a `music-package` segment checks that every
`NotationSystem` referenced by a projection blob has a corresponding `NotationProjectionProfile`,
and that the profile accounts for every `MusicalParameter` declared in the music slice (no silent
omissions).

## 14. Transforms out

Transforms convert GTS to operating substrates. Each is a thin shim over the folded tables —
no RDF text parser is involved.

- `gts → nquads` / `gts → turtle` — serialise `quads` + `reifies`/`annot` (the latter as RDF 1.2
  reification). Inline blobs are **externalised** to `./blobs/<blake3>.bin`, and the graph's
  digest references resolve to those paths. Opaque frames serialise as their opaque-node
  descriptions.
- `gts → duckdb` / `gts → sqlite` — bulk-load the four tables (`terms`, `quads`, `reifies`,
  `annot`) plus a `blobs` table; create the indexes appropriate to the engine. This is a
  near-mechanical load because the GTS tables already match the relational shape.

Each transform SHOULD be verifiable by **round-trip equivalence**: for **fully-decodable**
frames, `gts → nq → gts` MUST yield the same folded graph (modulo blank-node labelling and
deterministic CBOR re-encoding). Opaque nodes are excluded — they serialise as opaque-node
descriptions and re-import as ordinary quads, not as opaque frames.

### 14.1 Composition tooling requirements (normative for conformant tools)

Raw `cat` always works (§3.1); a conformant **validating composer** (`gts cat`) and verifier
(`gts verify`) add the refuse-don't-trust posture:

- **`gts cat` MUST refuse degenerate inputs**: an input that is not a valid GTS, a segment
  whose fold yields zero quads and zero blobs (almost always a wiring bug, never a real
  package), or an output in which a suppress-only segment would hide every prior frame.
  Publish-class tools never trust a pathological state to be intentional.
- **`gts verify` MUST check declared-vs-computed requirements**: a segment whose graph uses a
  profile's vocabulary without declaring the profile is an **error**; a declared-but-unused
  profile is a warning. Declarations a tool reads (the CLI dependency report, §13) must not be
  able to rot against the content they describe.
- **`gts verify` SHOULD report per-segment**: head id, signer set, profile, term/quad counts,
  opaque-node count with reasons — the composition ledger of the file.
- **`gts verify` MUST check the layout claim** (§3.3): a segment claiming
  `"layout": "streamable"` whose covered region violates delivery ordering, or whose index
  footer is missing or contradicts the frames it covers, is an **error**
  (`StreamableLayoutError`, §2.3); `stream#` vocabulary in an unclaimed segment is a
  **warning** (§13.3). `gts info` and `gts verify` SHOULD report the streamable boundary of
  a claimed segment — "streamable through frame *N*, accretive tail of *M* frame(s)".
- **`gts compact --streamable <in> -o <out>` is the layout rewrite** (§10.1). It MUST refuse
  input that does not verify cleanly, input carrying frame-addressed suppressions, and
  `evidence` input without the seal-the-original option (`--seal-original`, §10.1); it MUST
  emit a single claimed segment in the normative streamable shape (§3.3) with compaction
  provenance and detached signatures (§13.3), and its output MUST be byte-deterministic for
  the same input and parameters (blobs ordered by ascending decoded size, ties broken by
  ascending digest; the rewrite timestamp is a parameter, not ambient time).
- **Blob extraction is verification, never conversion** (`gts ls`, `gts extract`): blobs are
  addressed by content digest (frame indices are physical accidents that shift under `cat`);
  extraction re-hashes the bytes against the requested digest; a blob suppressed by digest
  (§11) is refused by default (suppression is a display contract and extraction is display) with
  an explicit override; a media-type flag is an **assertion** against the blob's declared
  `pub.mt` — a validating publication tool refuses a mismatch rather than transcoding.

### 14.2 Archive tooling (`files` profile)

The `files` profile adds three validating publication commands. They share the refuse-don't-trust posture
of §14.1: raw byte operations are always valid GTS, but a tool refuses pathological states
rather than trusting them to be intentional.

- **`gts pack <dir|file>... -o out.gts`**
  Produce a single-segment GTS whose header declares `"prof": "files"`. Each argument is
  archived: a file is added under its basename; a directory is added recursively. The resulting
  archive contains, in order, the `terms` and `quads` describing every `files:FileEntry`,
  followed by the inline `blob` frames for the file contents. The command MUST refuse:
  - inputs that contain `..` components or absolute paths in their stored path;
  - inputs that are not readable or that disappear during the walk.

- **`gts unpack <archive> [-C dir]`**
  Write every `files:FileEntry` in the archive to the destination directory (default current
  working directory). The command MUST:
  - refuse to write outside the destination directory (`..`, absolute paths, or symlinks that
    escape it);
  - re-hash each written file and verify it matches `files:digest`;
  - restore the file's declared modification time and permissions (subject to the host OS);
  - skip entries whose digest is suppressed (§11) by default, with an explicit
    `--include-suppressed` override.

- **`gts diff <archive> <dir>`**
  Compare the archive's `files:FileEntry` set to the current state of `<dir>` by content digest.
  Report added, removed, and modified paths. Exit `0` if the directory matches the archive
  exactly; exit `1` if any path differs or if the input is refused. No byte comparison is
  needed: content addressing makes the operation O(read) on the directory.

## 15. Worked examples

CBOR is shown in **diagnostic notation** (RFC 8949 §8). Hashes/signatures are elided as `h'…'`.

### 15.1 Minimal distribution snapshot (`dist`)

```text
55799(                                   / self-describe magic /
  { "gts": "GTS1", "v": 1, "prof": "dist",
    "cat": { 0: {"name":"identity","cls":"encode"},
             4: {"name":"zstd","cls":"compress"} },
    "id": h'…header.id…' }
)
{ "t": "terms", "prev": h'…header.id…', "id": h'…terms.id…',
  "d": [ {"k":0,"v":"https://example.org/Cat"},          / id 0 /
         {"k":0,"v":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label"},  / id 1 /
         {"k":1,"v":"Cat","l":"en"} ] }                  / id 2 /
{ "t": "quads", "prev": h'…terms.id…', "id": h'…', "x": [4],
  "d": h'…zstd([[0,1,2]])…' }                            / Cat rdfs:label "Cat"@en /
```

Term 2 is a literal with a language tag and no `"dt"`, so its datatype is `rdf:langString`
(§7.1).

### 15.2 Evidence: image + signed accrual (`evidence`)

```text
{ "t": "blob", "prev": h'…header.id…', "id": h'…',
  "pub": {"mt":"image/jp2"}, "d": h'…image bytes…',      / digest = blake3(d) /
  "sig": h'COSE_Sign1 by did:photographer' }
{ "t": "annot", "prev": h'…blob.id…', "id": h'…',
  "d": [[10,11,12]],                                     / reifier 10: capturedAt … /
  "sig": h'COSE_Sign1 by did:photographer' }
{ "t": "annot", "prev": h'…prev.id…', "id": h'…',        / later custody transfer, separate signer /
  "pub": {"event":"custody-transfer"},
  "d": [[13,11,14]], "sig": h'COSE_Sign1 by did:evidence-clerk' }
```

Nothing is rewritten; every accrual is hash-linked and independently signed.

### 15.3 Notary: partially-opaque frame (`opaque`)

```text
{ "t": "annot", "prev": h'…prev.id…', "id": h'…',
  "pub": { "claim": "I hereby notarized this document.",
           "notary": "did:notary:jane", "ts": "2026-06-09T12:00:00Z" },
  "x": [4, 7],                                            / 7 = cose-encrypt /
  "to": [ {"kid":"anon:7f3a…","alg":"ECDH-ES+A256KW"} ],  / pseudonymous kid (opaque profile, §18) /
  "d": h'COSE_Encrypt(verified ID record + provenance)',
  "sig": h'COSE_Sign1 by did:notary:jane' }
```

Anyone verifies the public notarization and its signature; only the court key decrypts the
sealed record; the signature binds the two (§9.2). A reader without the court key folds this to
an opaque node with `reason:"missing-key"`, `pub` intact, `sigstat:"valid"`.

### 15.4 Graceful degradation (`image`, content negotiation)

```text
{ "t": "blob", "prev": h'…', "id": h'…', "pub": {"mt":"image/vnd.djvu","rep":"master"}, "x":[9], "d": h'…' }
{ "t": "blob", "prev": h'…', "id": h'…', "pub": {"mt":"image/jpeg","rep":"fallback"}, "d": h'…' }
```

A reader lacking codec `9` (djvu) folds the master to an opaque node and uses the JPEG
fallback — both are present, both are hash-linked.

### 15.5 Matryoshka: a whole signed GTS sealed inside a frame (`bundle` / `opaque`)

```text
{ "t": "blob", "prev": h'…', "id": h'…',
  "pub": { "rep": "sealed-evidence-graph", "mt": "application/gts" },  / payload is itself a GTS /
  "x": [4, 7],                                            / zstd then cose-encrypt /
  "to": [ {"kid":"did:court:registry"} ],
  "d": h'COSE_Encrypt( zstd( <a complete, independently-signed GTS file> ) )' }
```

Without the court key this folds to one opaque node — a whole subgraph the holder carries but
cannot read, yet whose presence and position the outer chain proves. With the key, a Full
Reader recurses (§12.1) and folds the inner GTS — header, chain, signatures and all — into a
verifiable subgraph.

## 16. Media type and HTTP serving contract

GTS files are published artifacts. A conformant deployment MUST advertise the
media type, support range requests, and set cache headers that respect the format's immutability.

### 16.1 Media type and file extension (normative)

- **Media type:** `application/vnd.blackcat.gts+cbor` (registration template in §20.1).
  The `+cbor` structured-syntax suffix (RFC 9277) makes the CBOR-family membership explicit.
- **File extension:** `.gts`.
- **Magic bytes:** the CBOR self-describe tag `55799` (`0xd9 0xd9 0xf7`) at the start of the
  first segment's Header. A reader MAY use these three bytes to identify a GTS file before
  parsing the rest of the CBOR Sequence.

Servers that do not recognise `application/vnd.blackcat.gts+cbor` SHOULD fall back to
`application/octet-stream` rather than a wrong text type; clients SHOULD sniff the self-describe
tag when the media type is missing or generic.

### 16.2 HTTP serving semantics (normative)

A GTS package is served like any other immutable binary release, with three extra requirements:

1. **`Accept-Ranges: bytes`** MUST be sent for every `.gts` response. The format is designed for
   partial, streaming consumption (§3.2): a consumer can fold the header and a prefix of frames
   without downloading the whole file, and Range requests map directly onto CBOR item boundaries.
2. **No transforms at the edge.** Because the bytes are a content-addressed chain, proxies and
   servers MUST NOT apply compression, minification, or any byte-altering transform. The frames
   are already compressed by the writer's chosen codec; re-compressing at the transport layer
   breaks content hashes and signatures.
3. **CORS.** A public vocabulary/dataset package is expected to be cross-origin readable.
   Responses SHOULD include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` for the served `.gts` origin.

### 16.3 Immutability-aware caching (normative)

Published GTS releases are immutable; a GTS package URL names one exact byte sequence.

- **Versioned URLs** (`…/gmeow/1.2.3/gmeow.gts`, `…/packages/music/2026-06-11/music.gts`, or any
  URL that contains a version/date/head identifier) MUST be served with:

  ```text
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
  ETag: "<last-segment-head>"
  ```

  The natural ETag is the hex of the file's last segment head id (§3.1), because it transitively
  commits to every byte of the file. The `immutable` directive tells caches they need not
  revalidate for the one-year lifetime.
- **`latest` / conneg aliases** (URLs that resolve to the current release and may change) MUST
  NOT be cached as a single variant:

  ```text
  Cache-Control: private, no-store
  Vary: Accept
  ```

  The `Vary: Accept` prevents conneg-cache poisoning when the same path negotiates to HTML,
  Turtle, or the GTS package. This is the same cache-poisoning class addressed for slice IRIs
  by the Apache generator.

Profile selection remains URL-shaped in v0.2: one URL per package. RFC 6906 / `Accept-Profile`
is noted as a possible future extension, not required for v0.2 conformance.

## 17. Versioning and durability guarantees

- The header `"v"` is the spec major version. A reader MUST refuse a major version it does not
  implement, but MUST still verify the id/prev chain and enumerate frame types/ids.
- **Segment semantics and older readers.** A reader implementing this revision MUST support
  segment boundaries (§3.1). A reader that does NOT (a pre-§3.1 implementation) encounters a
  second Header as a non-frame data item: such input is **malformed for that reader**, and it
  MUST surface a fatal diagnostic for the remainder of the file rather than skip the item —
  *silently misfolding (applying file-global term-ids across a boundary) is the one forbidden
  outcome* (vector 17). Because `cat` cannot rewrite the first segment's header (the self-hash
  seals it), multi-segment files cannot advertise themselves in the first header; boundary
  detection is therefore structural, and the hard-fail rule is what protects the ecosystem's
  oldest readers.
- **Structure durability:** a GTS file plus this specification is decodable forever with no
  engine and no external dictionary — CBOR is an IETF standard and dictionaries are in-band.
- **Density durability:** governed by the codec catalog; the mandatory core set
  (`identity`/`gzip`/`zstd`) guarantees a baseline that any era can decode.

## 18. Security considerations

- The id/prev chain provides integrity, **not** confidentiality; use `encrypt`-class codecs for
  confidentiality.
- **Truncation** (dropping trailing frames) is undetectable from the chain alone; an `evidence`
  artifact MUST anchor the head — a signature over the head `"id"`, or the index `"head"`/`"mmr"`
  root (§6.2) — so a verifier can detect a shortened log.
- **Recovery** of frames *after* a damaged one is guaranteed only with known offsets (an intact
  index, a checkpoint frame, or external framing); a bare CBOR Sequence can desynchronise on
  arbitrary corruption (§9.1). GTS defines no parity/erasure coding — durability against bulk
  loss is the storage layer's concern.
- `"to"`/`kid` values can leak relationship metadata (who a frame is sealed for). The `opaque`
  profile therefore REQUIRES pseudonymous `kid`s; other high-privacy profiles SHOULD use them.
  Use a per-document or pairwise identifier — e.g. `"kid": "anon:<BLAKE3(true-kid ∥ head-id)>"` —
  or key blinding, so the same recipient is unlinkable across files.
- A valid signature attests the signer over the frame's bytes; it does **not** assert the truth
  of the claims (consistent with attestation semantics — vouching ≠ correctness).
- Opaque frames are unreadable but **not** invisible; do not place secrets in `"pub"`,
  `"to"`, or `"meta"`.
- Snapshot compaction (§10) destroys original signatures; an `evidence` artifact MUST NOT be
  snapshot-compacted. Streamable compaction (§10.1) detaches frame signatures rather than
  destroying them, but the re-ordered chain is attested only by the compactor; an `evidence`
  artifact MUST NOT be streamable-compacted except by sealing the original verbatim (§10.1),
  and a consumer's trust in the *ordering* of a compacted file is trust in the compactor.
- Decompression of attacker-supplied frames MUST be bounded (zip-bomb resistance); readers
  SHOULD cap decoded sizes.
- Nested GTS (§12.1) MUST be bounded: readers MUST enforce a maximum recursion depth and a
  total decoded-size budget across all nesting levels (matryoshka-bomb resistance).
- **Segments are independently authentic, not mutually vouched.** Concatenation implies no
  endorsement: segment A's signer attests nothing about segment B. A verifier MUST report
  signer sets per segment (§14.1), and a consumer deciding trust MUST NOT treat the file-level
  union as carrying the strongest segment's authority. Value-wise cross-segment suppression
  (§11) means an untrusted appended segment can HIDE earlier content from default resolution —
  readers SHOULD surface which segment suppressed what, and high-assurance consumers MAY
  resolve suppression only from segments whose signers they trust.
- A torn append at a segment boundary looks like a torn header: the §3 torn-append rule
  applies; the prior segments fold intact.

## 19. Conformance test vectors

A conformant implementation MUST pass a shared corpus. v1 requires at least these vectors
(shipped with the reference implementation), each as the GTS bytes plus the expected folded graph
(N-Quads) and the expected diagnostics:

1. Minimal valid file (header + one `terms` + one `quads`).
2. A `zstd`-transformed `quads` frame.
3. An unknown-codec frame → opaque `reason:"unknown-codec"`.
4. A frame with a wrong self-`"id"` → `DamagedFrame` opaque.
5. A torn append at EOF → `TornAppendError`, survivors intact.
6. Header self-hash verification (positive and tampered).
7. RDF 1.2 reifier + `annot` round-trip (`gts → nq → gts`), including quotation-without-assertion.
8. A nested GTS blob (`mt: application/gts`), recursed and folded.
9. Suppression over a term-id and over a frame digest.
10. Truncation detection against a signed head / index `"mmr"` root.
11. Literal datatype defaulting (§7.1): a literal with `"l"` and no `"dt"` → `rdf:langString`;
    with neither → `xsd:string`.
12. A reifier rebound to a different triple → `ConflictingReifier`, first binding kept (§7.8).
13. A position-constraint violation, e.g. a literal in predicate position → rejected/diagnosed
    (§7.4).
14. Blank-node label locality (§7.1, §12.1): identical bnode labels in an outer and a nested GTS
    remain isolated (not merged).
15. **Two-segment union (§3.1)**: `cat` of two single-segment files folds to the value-union of
    both graphs; term-ids resolve segment-locally (a shared IRI unifies; identical ids naming
    different values do NOT collide); identical bnode labels across segments stay isolated.
    *15b*: label-less blank nodes (absent **or empty** `"v"`) are distinct terms within a
    segment and across segments, and the union's serialized labels MUST keep them distinct —
    relabeling that merges what the graph separates is the forbidden outcome.
16. **Composed round-trip (§3.1, §14)**: a `cat`-composed file survives `gts → nq → gts` with
    the same union fold.
17. **Pre-segment reader hard-fail (§17, negative)**: an implementation in pre-§3.1 mode fed a
    two-segment file MUST surface a fatal diagnostic at the second header — folding frames past
    the boundary with file-global term-ids is the forbidden outcome this vector exists to catch.
18. **Cross-segment suppression (§11)**: a second segment suppresses (a) an earlier segment's
    frame by digest and (b) a quad by value; default resolution hides both; the suppressed
    segment's bytes verify intact; the verifier reports which segment suppressed what (§18).
19. **Profile union + graceful segment opacity (§3.1)**: a two-segment file whose second
    segment requires an undeclared-to-the-reader capability folds segment one fully and
    segment two as opaque nodes with the profile named in the diagnostics.
20. **Language-tag discipline (§13.1, negative)**: a producer emitting a private-use language
    tag into a projection/docs section MUST fail at write time; the same tag in a canonical
    `dist` payload section is accepted.
21. **Degenerate composition refused (§14.1, negative)**: `gts cat` refuses an empty-fold
    segment and a suppress-everything composition; raw byte `cat` of the same inputs still
    yields a structurally valid file (the tool is stricter than the format, by design).
22. **Inline blob (§12, §14.1)**: an inline blob folds to its `blake3:<hex>` digest with
    declared metadata (`pub.mt`) retained; extraction by digest re-verifies the bytes;
    a digest-suppressed blob is refused by default.
23. **Prefix-fold streaming property (§3.2, derived)**: not a vector but a property test over
    EVERY vector in this corpus — each item-boundary prefix folds without error, and across
    growing prefixes the folded tables only ever extend (terms/quads are list-prefixes while
    the segment count is unchanged; ground (blank-node-free) N-Quads lines are monotone
    across the single→multi-segment representation switch).
24. **Streamable compaction (§3.3, §10.1, §13.3)**: an accretive source (blobs interleaved
    before their catalog, one COSE-signed frame, no claim) and its compacted rewrite — the
    rewrite claims `"layout": "streamable"`, leads with the streaming index, orders blobs
    most-significant-first, closes with the offset `index` footer, and carries compaction
    provenance including the detached source signature; both files fold to the same content
    graph; the compacted bytes are **frozen** and double as the cross-engine determinism
    oracle (same input + same timestamp parameter ⇒ byte-identical output in every engine).
25. **Streamable claim that lies (§3.3, negative)**: a segment claiming
    `"layout": "streamable"` that delivers a covered blob before the quads describing its
    digest → `StreamableLayoutError`; a verifying tool MUST refuse (exit non-zero).
26. **Appended-after-compaction boundary (§3.3)**: a compacted segment with frames appended
    after its `index` footer folds cleanly with no diagnostic, and tooling reports
    "streamable through frame *N*, accretive tail" — the unpresaged tail is legal.

## 20. IANA considerations

This section registers one media type. It follows the registration procedures of
[RFC 6838] and the structured-syntax-suffix procedures of [RFC 9277]. Pending formal
registration, the type lives in the vendor (`vnd.`) tree and is used provisionally.

### 20.1 Media type registration: `application/vnd.blackcat.gts+cbor`

- **Type name:** `application`
- **Subtype name:** `vnd.blackcat.gts+cbor`
- **Required parameters:** none
- **Optional parameters:** none
- **Encoding considerations:** binary. A GTS file is a CBOR Sequence ([RFC 8742]) and is
  not restricted to 7-bit or 8-bit text; transports that are not 8-bit clean MUST apply a
  content-transfer-encoding (e.g. base64).
- **Security considerations:** see §18 of this specification. In summary: the content-id
  chain provides integrity but not confidentiality; truncation is undetectable without a head
  commitment; decompression and nested-GTS recursion MUST be bounded; and signatures attest a
  signer over bytes, not the truth of claims.
- **Interoperability considerations:** the `+cbor` structured-syntax suffix ([RFC 9277])
  signals CBOR-family membership, so generic CBOR tooling can inspect the outer structure. The
  self-describe tag `55799` ([RFC 8949] §3.4.6) MAY prefix the first segment header as a magic
  number. Conformance is defined by the shared test-vector corpus (§19).
- **Published specification:** this document (GTS — Graph Transport Substrate — Specification).
- **Applications that use this media type:** content-addressed RDF 1.2 graph transport and
  archival; signed agent-memory and provenance artifacts; package distribution where the payload
  bundles a graph and the binaries it references.
- **Fragment identifier considerations:** none.
- **Additional information:**
  - **Magic number(s):** `0xd9 0xd9 0xf7` (the CBOR self-describe tag `55799`) when present at
    the start of the file (§16.1). This prefix is OPTIONAL.
  - **File extension(s):** `.gts`
  - **Macintosh file type code(s):** none
- **Person & email address to contact for further information:**
  Patrick Audley <paudley@blackcatinformatics.ca>
- **Intended usage:** COMMON
- **Restrictions on usage:** none
- **Author / Change controller:** Blackcat Informatics® Inc.
