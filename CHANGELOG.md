# Changelog

All notable changes to GTS are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The four engines are
released in **lockstep** under a single version (the Go module is tagged
`go-v<version>`); see [`scripts/check-versions.sh`](./scripts/check-versions.sh).

The wire format is a working draft (`GTS-SPEC.md` is at draft `v0.3`) and MAY
change before `1.0`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Live cross-engine interoperability check (`scripts/interop.sh`): every engine
  packs a fixture and every other engine folds/unpacks it, asserting identical
  results — interop coverage beyond the Python-generated frozen corpus.
- Fuzzing for the readers: Rust `cargo-fuzz` target and Go native `FuzzRead`,
  seeded from the conformance corpus, run on a schedule and as a PR smoke test.
- Supply-chain vulnerability scanning across all four lockfiles (osv-scanner).
- Cross-platform CI (Linux, macOS, Windows) for every engine's build and tests.
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build gate for the Rust library.
- Developer `justfile`, a lockstep version-sync check, and this changelog.
- Full release attestations across all four engines: SLSA build-provenance
  attestations and SPDX SBOMs for the crate, the npm tarball (in addition to
  npm's sigstore provenance), the Python distributions, and the Go binaries.
- npm releases use trusted publishing (OIDC); the Go release cross-builds and
  publishes attested binaries (replacing the Pro-only goreleaser monorepo setup).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- Initial public import of GTS into the standalone `gmeow-gts` repository: four
  interoperable engines (Rust, Python, Go, TypeScript), the `GTS-SPEC.md`
  specification, and the frozen conformance corpus.
- Triple licensing: `MIT OR Apache-2.0 OR proprietary`.
